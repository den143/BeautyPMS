# BPMS - Beauty Pageant Management System

BPMS is a lightweight landing and management interface for beauty pageants. This repository contains a simple Vite-based static frontend for event management, contestant registration, judge scoring, and audience voting demonstrations.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`

## Notes
- Project has been renamed locally to remove `bolt_` prefixes from filenames and paths in source code.
- The Git remote may still reference the original repository name on GitHub; do not change it unless the remote repo has been renamed.
